HR analytics aim to provide insight into how best to manage employees and reach business goals. The objective is to monitor key HR metrics on employees and identify what factors impact attrition. The analysis is performed using a HR dataset for a software company called Atlas Labs.
Created several reports with information on following factors which will help the company determine what action they will need to take to retain more employees.

Overview- total employees, active employees, inactive employees, attrition rate, etc.
Demographics- age, gender, ethnicity, seniority, etc.
Performance Tracker- job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, self rating, manager rating, etc.
Attrition- attrition rate on the basis of tenure, overtime requirement, job role, etc.
